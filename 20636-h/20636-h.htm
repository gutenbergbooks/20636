<p>Having been, for several years, engaged in the establishment of a
Museum in Poughkeepsie, I have, by extensive travel and research, and
by the kindness of many of my fellow-citizens in Dutchess county and
elsewhere, obtained numerous objects, not only curious in themselves,
but valuable as materials for history. Among these are two manuscript
Journals, kept by common soldiers, each during a single campaign, and
written at periods seventeen years apart. One of these soldiers served
in a campaign of the conflict known as the <span class="smcap">French and Indian War</span>,
which commenced a hundred years ago; the other soldier assisted in the
siege of Boston, by the American army, in 1775 and 1776. Believing
that a faithful transcript of those Journals, given <i>verbatim et
literatim</i>, as recorded by the actors themselves, might have an
interest for American readers, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006"></a>(p. 006)</span> as exhibiting the every-day
life of a common soldier in those wars which led to the founding of
our republic, I have yielded to the solicitations of friends, and the
dictates of my own judgment and feelings, and in the following pages
present to the public faithful copies of those diaries.</p>

<p>Perceiving that much of the intrinsic value of these Journals would
consist in a proper understanding of the historical facts to which
allusions are made in them, I prevailed upon Mr. <span class="smcap">Lossing</span>, the
well-known author of the "<i>Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution</i>" to
illustrate and elucidate these diaries by explanatory notes. His name
is a sufficient guaranty for their accuracy and general usefulness;
and I flatter myself that this little volume will not only amuse, but
edify, and that the useful objects aimed at in its publication will be
fully attained. With this hope, it is submitted to my fellow-citizens.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h2> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007"></a>(p. 007)</span>


<p>The conflict known in America as the <i>French and Indian War</i>, and in
Europe as the <i>Seven Years' War</i>, originated in disputes between the
French and English colonists, in the New World, concerning territorial
limits. For a century the colonies of the two nations had been
gradually expanding and increasing in importance. The English, more
than a million in number, occupied the seaboard from the Penobscot to
the St. Mary's, a thousand miles in extent; all eastward of the great
ranges of the Alleganies, and far northward toward the St. Lawrence.
The French, not more than a hundred thousand strong, made settlements
along the St. Lawrence, the shores of the great lakes, on the
Mississippi and its tributaries, and upon the borders of the gulf of
Mexico. They early founded Detroit, Kaskaskia, Vincennes, and New
Orleans.</p>

<p>The English planted agricultural colonies&mdash;the French were chiefly
engaged in traffic with the Indians. This trade, and the operations of
the Jesuit missionaries, who were usually the self-denying pioneers of
commerce in its penetration of the wilderness, gave <span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008"></a>(p. 008)</span> the
French great influence over the tribes of a vast extent of country
lying in the rear of the English settlements.</p>

<p>The ancient quarrel between the two nations, originating far back in
the feudal ages, and kept alive by subsequent collisions, burned
vigorously in the bosoms of the respective colonists in America, where
it was continually fed by frequent hostilities on frontier ground.
They had ever regarded each other with extreme jealousy, for the prize
before them was supreme rule in the New World. The trading-posts and
missionary-stations of the French, in the far Northwest, and in the
bosom of the dark wilderness, several hundred miles distant from the
most remote settlements on the English frontier, attracted very little
attention until they formed a part of more extensive operations. But
when, after the capture of Louisburg, by the English, in 1745, the
French adopted vigorous measures for opposing the extension of British
power in America; when they built strong vessels at the foot of Lake
Ontario&mdash;made treaties of friendship with powerful Indian
tribes&mdash;strengthened their fort at the mouth of the Niagara river&mdash;and
erected a cordon of fortifications, more than sixty in number, between
Montreal and New Orleans,&mdash;the English were aroused to immediate and
effective action in defence of the territorial limits given them in
their ancient charters. By virtue of these, they claimed dominion
westward to the Pacific ocean, south of the latitude of the north
shore <span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span> of Lake Erie; while the French claimed a title to all
the territory watered by the Mississippi and its tributaries, under
the more plausible plea that they had made the first explorations and
settlements in that region. The claims of the real owner&mdash;the
Indian&mdash;were lost sight of in the discussion; and it was a significant
question asked by an Indian messenger of the agent of the English
<i>Ohio Company</i>: "Where is the Indian's land? The English claim it all
on one side of the river, and the French on the other: where does the
Indian's land lie?"</p>

<p>The territorial question was brought to an issue when, in 1753, a
company of English traders and settlers commenced exploring the
head-waters of the Ohio. The French opposed their operations by force.
George Washington was sent by the Virginia authorities to remonstrate
with the French. It was of no avail. The English determined to oppose
force to force; and in the vicinity of the now-flourishing city of
Pittsburg, in western Pennsylvania, the "French and Indian War" began.
Provincial troops were raised, and armies came from England. Extensive
campaigns were planned, and attempts were made to expel the French
from Lake Champlain and the southern shore of Lake Ontario. Finally,
in 1758, three armies were in motion at one time against French posts
remote from each other&mdash;Louisburg, in the extreme east; Ticonderoga,
on Lake Champlain; and Fort Du Quesne, where Pittsburg now stands.
General Sir James Abercrombie commanded <span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> the expedition
against Ticonderoga, accompanied by young Lord Howe as his lieutenant.
The French were under the command of the marquis Montcalm, who was
killed at Quebec the following year. The English and provincial troops
rendezvoused at the head of Lake George, went down that sheet of
water, attacked Ticonderoga, and were repulsed with great loss. It was
this portion of that campaign in which the soldier served who kept the
Journal given in the succeeding pages. It is a graphic outline
picture, in few and simple words, of the daily life of a common
soldier at that time.</p>

<p>During the campaign of 1759, Quebec was captured by the army under
Wolfe; Lord Amherst, more successful than Abercrombie, drove the
French from Lake Champlain; Sir William Johnson captured Fort Niagara;
and all Canada was in virtual possession of the English, except
Montreal. That fell early in the Autumn of 1760; and the struggle for
supremacy in America, between the French and English, was ended for
ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The soldiers had, necessarily, a great deal of leisure
     during permanent camp-duties, and contrived various ways to amuse
     themselves, and "kill time." In those days the common soldiers
     carried their powder in the horns of cows or oxen, and many
     amused themselves by ornamenting them by a skilful use of their
     knives. Below is a specimen of one of these ornamented horns,
     prepared during the campaign of 1758. Upon it is neatly cut the
     figure of a fortified building (a part of which is seen in the
     engraving), the owner's name, and a verse, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h2>A JOURNAL FOR 1775, A. D.</h2>




<h2>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h2> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page049" name="page049"></a>(p. 049)</span>


<p>The following is a literal transcript of a Journal kept by a common
soldier named <span class="smcap">Samuel Haws</span>, of Wrentham, Massachusetts, who appears to
have been one of the <i>minute-men</i>, organized toward the close of 1774
and early in 1775. At that time there were about three thousand
British troops in Boston, under General Thomas Gage, who was also
governor of the colony of Massachusetts. He was popularly regarded as
an oppressor; and act after act of the British government, during a
year preceding, had convinced the American people that they must
choose the alternative to submit or fight. They resolved to fight, if
necessary. During the summer of 1774, the people commenced arming, and
training themselves in military exercises; the manufacture of arms and
gunpowder was encouraged; and throughout Massachusetts, in particular,
the people were enrolled in companies, and prepared to take up arms at
a moment's warning. From this circumstance they were called
"<span class="smcap">Minute-Men</span>."</p>

<p>With his strong force, Gage felt quite certain that he could suppress
the threatened insurrection, and keep the people quiet. Yet he felt
uneasy concerning the gathering of ammunition and stores by the
patriots at Concord, sixteen miles from Boston; and on the night of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page050" name="page050"></a>(p. 050)</span> the 18th of April, 1775, he sent a detachment of soldiers to
seize them. They proceeded by the way of Lexington, where they arrived
at dawn of the 19th. The expedition became known, and the country was
aroused. When the British approached Lexington, they were confronted
by about seventy minute-men. A skirmish ensued: eight patriots were
killed, and several were wounded. <i>That was the first bloodshed of the
Revolution.</i> The British then went on to Concord, to seize the stores,
where they were again confronted by minute-men. Indeed, they had been
annoyed all the way by them, as they fired from behind buildings,
stone-walls, and trees. They destroyed the stores, and in a skirmish
killed several more American citizens. The country was now thoroughly
aroused, and the minute-men hastened toward Lexington and Concord from
all directions. The British found it necessary to retreat, and nothing
saved the whole troop sent out the night before from utter
destruction, but a strong reinforcement under Lord Percy. The whole
body retreated hastily to Charlestown, and across to Boston, with a
loss, in killed and wounded, of two hundred and seventy-three men.
Intelligence of the tragedy soon spread over the country, and from the
hills and valleys of New England thousands of men, armed and unarmed,
hastened toward Boston, and formed that force (of which our Journalist
was one) that, for nine months, kept the British army prisoners upon
the peninsulas of Boston and Charlestown. By common consent, Artemas
Ward, a soldier of the French and Indian war, was made
commander-in-chief, and he performed the duties of that office with
zeal until he was superseded by Washington, early in July, 1775.</p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENT.</h3> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093"></a>(p. 093)</span>

<h5>OFFICIAL PAPERS<br>
<span class="smcap">concerning</span><br> THE SKIRMISHES AT LEXINGTON AND CONCORD.</h5>


<p>In the preceding Journal of a Soldier, in 1775, his narrative
commences on the day of the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord, the
opening conflicts of the Revolution. Some official matters relating to
those events, which are inaccessible to the general reading-public,
will doubtless be acceptable, as they certainly are appropriate, in
this connection.</p>

<p>The skirmishes occurred on the 19th of April, 1775. On the 22d, the
Provincial Congress of Massachusetts assembled, and, deeming it
important to have the whole truth known, appointed a committee to take
depositions in relation to the transactions of the British troops in
their route to and from Concord. Another committee was appointed the
following day, consisting of Dr. Church, Elbridge Gerry, and Thomas
Cushing, to draw up a narrative of the massacre. The committee to
take <span class="pagenum"><a id="page094" name="page094"></a>(p. 094)</span> depositions held their sessions at Concord and
Lexington, on the 23d and 25th of April. Feeling it to be expedient to
send an account immediately to England, a committee, consisting of Dr.
Warren, Mr. Freeman, Mr. Gardiner, and Colonel Stone, was chosen to
prepare a letter to Dr. Franklin, the colonial agent in London. They
reported a letter, and also an "Address to the Inhabitants of Great
Britain," on the same day. Captain Richard Derby, of Salem, was
employed to proceed immediately with the despatches. He placed them in
the hands of Doctor Franklin on the 29th of May, and on the following
day the address was printed and circulated. It gave the first
intelligence of the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord, to the
British public.</p>

<p>The following, copied from the Journals of the Continental Congress,
are the several papers referred to:&mdash;</p>

<div class="left05">
<p>"<i>To the Hon. Benjamin Franklin, Esq., at London.</i></p>

<p class="add2em">"<span class="smcap">In Provincial Congress, Watertown</span>, <i>April 26, 1775</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: From the entire confidence we repose in your faithfulness and
abilities, we consider it the happiness of this colony that the
important trust of agency for it, in this day of unequalled distress,
is devolved on your hands, and we doubt not your attachment to the
cause and liberties of mankind will make every possible exertion in
our behalf a pleasure to you; although our circumstances will compel
us often to interrupt your <span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095"></a>(p. 095)</span> repose, by matters that will
surely give you pain. A singular instance hereof is the occasion of
the present letter. The contents of this packet will be our apology
for troubling you with it.</p>

<p>"From these you will see how, and by whom, we are at last plunged into
the horrors of a most unnatural war.</p>

<p>"Our enemies, we are told, have despatched to Great Britain a
fallacious account of the tragedy they have begun; to prevent the
operation of which to the public injury, we have engaged the vessel
that conveys this to you, as a packet in the service of this colony,
and we request your assistance in supplying Captain Derby, who
commands her, with such necessaries as he shall want, on the credit of
your constituents in Massachusetts Bay.</p>

<p>"But we most ardently wish that the several papers herewith enclosed
may be immediately printed and dispersed through every town in
England, and especially communicated to the lord-mayor, aldermen, and
council, of the city of London, that they may take such order thereon
as they may think proper. And we are confident your fidelity will make
such improvement of them as shall convince all, who are not determined
to be in everlasting blindness, that it is the united efforts of both
Englands that can save either: but that whatever price our brethren in
the one may be pleased to put on their constitutional liberties, we
are authorized to assure you that the inhabitants of the other, with
the greatest <span class="pagenum"><a id="page096" name="page096"></a>(p. 096)</span> unanimity, are inflexibly resolved to sell
theirs only at the price of their lives.</p>

follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="left05">
<p class="left50"><span class="smcap">"Lexington</span>, <i>April 25, 1775.</i></p>

<p>"We, Solomon Brown, Jonathan Loring, and Elijah Sanderson, all of
lawful age, and of Lexington, in the county of Middlesex, and colony
of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, do testify and declare that,
on the evening of the 18th of April, instant, being on the road
between Concord and Lexington, and all of us mounted on horses, we
were, about ten of the clock, suddenly surprised by nine persons, whom
we took to be regular officers, who rode up to us, mounted and armed,
each having a pistol in his hand, and, after putting pistols to our
breasts, and seizing the bridles of our horses, they swore, if we
stirred another step, we should be all dead men, upon which we
surrendered ourselves. They detained us until two o'clock the next
morning, in which time they searched and greatly abused us, having
first inquired about the magazine at Concord, whether any guards were
posted there, and whether the bridges were up, and said four or five
regiments of regulars would be in possession of the stores soon. They
then brought us back to Lexington, cut the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097"></a>(p. 097)</span> horses' bridles
and girths, turned them loose, and then left us.</p>

<div class="left05 p2">
<p class="left50"><span class="smcap">"Lexington</span>, <i>April 25, 1775</i>.</p>

<p>"I, Elijah Sanderson, above named, do further testify and declare,
that I was on Lexington common, the morning of the 19th of April
aforesaid, having been dismissed by the officers above mentioned, and
saw a large body of regular troops advancing toward Lexington company,
many of whom were then dispersing. I heard one of the regulars, whom I
took to be an officer, say, "Damn them, we will have them;" and
immediately the regulars shouted aloud, run and fired upon the
Lexington company, which did not fire a gun before the regulars
discharged on them. Eight of the Lexington company were killed while
they were dispersing, and at a considerable distance from each other,
and many wounded; and, although a spectator, I narrowly escaped with
my life.</p>

<div class="left05 p2">
<p class="left50"><span class="smcap">"Lexington</span>, <i>April 23, 1775</i>.</p>

<p>"I, Thomas Rice Willard, of lawful age, do testify and declare that,
being in the house of Daniel Harrington, of said Lexington, on the
19th instant, in the morning, about half an hour before sunrise,
looked out at the window of said house, and saw (as I suppose) about
four hundred regulars in one body, coming up the road, and marched
toward the north part of the common, back <span class="pagenum"><a id="page098" name="page098"></a>(p. 098)</span> of the
meeting-house of said Lexington; and as soon as said regulars were
against the east end of the meeting-house, the commanding officer said
something, what I know not, but upon that the regulars ran till they
came within about eight or nine rods of about a hundred of the militia
of Lexington, who were collected on said common, at which time the
militia of Lexington dispersed. Then the officers made a huzza, and
the private soldiers succeeded them: directly after this, an officer
rode before the regulars to the other side of the body, and hallooed
after the militia of said Lexington, and said, "Lay down your arms,
damn you, why don't you lay down your arms?"&mdash;and that there was not a
gun fired till the militia of Lexington were dispersed. And further
saith not.</p>

<p class="left50"><span class="smcap">"Lexington</span>, <i>April 25, 1775</i>.</p>

<p>"Simon Winship, of Lexington, in the county of Middlesex, and province
of Massachusetts Bay, New England, being of lawful age, testifieth and
saith, that on the 19th April instant, about four o'clock in the
morning, as he was passing the public road in said Lexington,
peaceably and unarmed, about two miles and a half distant from the
meeting-house in said Lexington, he was met by a body of the king's
regular troops, and being stopped by some officers of said troops, was
commanded to dismount. Upon asking why he must dismount, he was
obliged by force to quit his horse, and ordered <span class="pagenum"><a id="page099" name="page099"></a>(p. 099)</span> to march in
the midst of the body; and, being examined whether he had been warning
the minute-men, he answered, 'No, but had been out, and was then
returning to his father's.' Said Winship farther testifies that he
marched with said troops, till he came within about half a quarter of
a mile of said meeting-house, where an officer commanded the troops to
halt, and then to prime and load: this being done, the said troops
marched on till they came within a few rods of Captain Parker's
company, who were partly collected on the place of parade, when said
Winship observed an officer at the head of said troops, flourishing
his sword, and with a loud voice giving the word, 'Fire! fire!' which
was instantly followed by a discharge of arms from said regular
troops; and said Winship is positive, and in the most solemn manner
declares, that there was no discharge of arms on either side, till the
word 'Fire' was given by the said officer as above.</p>

<p class="left50"><span class="smcap">Lexington</span>, <i>April 25, 1775</i>.</p>

<p>"I, John Parker, of lawful age, and commander of the militia in
Lexington, do testify and declare that, on the 19th instant, in the
morning, about one of the clock, being informed that there were a
number of regula-officers riding up and down the road, stopping and
insulting people as they passed the road; and also was informed that a
number of regular troops were on their march from Boston, in order to
take the province stores at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> Concord, ordered our militia to
meet on the common in said Lexington, to consult what to do, and
concluded not to be discovered, nor meddle or make with said regular
troops (if they should approach), unless they should insult or molest
us; and, upon their sudden approach, I immediately ordered our militia
to disperse, and not to fire. Immediately said troops made their
appearance, and rushed furiously, fired upon, and killed eight of our
party, without receiving any provocation therefor from us.</p>

<p class="left50"><span class="smcap">Lexington</span>, <i>April 24, 1775</i>.</p>


<p>"I, John Robins, being of lawful age, do testify and say that, on the
19th instant, the company under the command of Captain John Parker,
being drawn up (some time before sunrise) on the green or common, and
I being in the front rank, there suddenly appeared a number of the
king's troops, about a thousand, as I thought, at the distance of
about sixty or seventy yards from us, huzzaing, and on a quick pace
toward us, with three officers in their front on horseback, and on
full gallop toward us, the foremost of which cried, 'Throw down your
arms, ye villains, ye rebels!' upon which said company dispersing, the
foremost of the three officers ordered their men, saying, 'Fire, by
God! fire!' at which moment we received a very heavy and close fire
from them; at which instant, being wounded, I fell, and several of our
men were shot dead by me. Captain <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> Parker's men, I believe,
had not then fired a gun. And further the deponent saith not.</p>

<p>"We, Benjamin Tidd, of Lexington, and Joseph Abbot, of Lincoln, in the
county of Middlesex, and colony of Massachusetts Bay, in New England,
of lawful age, do testify and declare that, on the morning of the 19th
of April instant, about five o'clock, being on Lexington common, and
mounted on horses, we saw a body of regular troops marching up to the
Lexington company, which was then dispersing. Soon after, the regulars
fired, first, a few guns, which we took to be pistols from some of the
regulars who were mounted on horses, and then the said regulars fired
a volley or two before any guns were fired by the Lexington company;
our horses immediately started, and we rode off. And further say not.</p>

morning, being informed that several officers of the regulars had, the
evening before, been riding up and down the road, and had detained and
insulted the inhabitants passing the same; and also understanding that
a body of regulars were marching from Boston toward Concord, with
intent (as it was supposed) to take the stores, belonging to the
colony, in that town, we were alarmed, and having met at the place of
our company's parade, were dismissed by our captain, John Parker, for
the present, with orders to be ready to attend at the beat of the
drum. We further testify and declare, that, about five o'clock in the
morning, hearing our drum beat, we proceeded toward the parade, and
soon found that a large body of troops were marching toward us. Some
of our company were coming up to the parade, and others had reached
it, at which time the company began to disperse. While our backs were
turned on the troops, we were fired on by them, and a number of our
men were instantly killed and wounded. Not a gun was fired by any
person in our company on the regulars, to our knowledge, before they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span> fired on us, and they continued firing until we had all made
our escape.</p>

the road the evening and night preceding, and that some of the
inhabitants, as they were passing, had been insulted by the officers,
and stopped by them; and being also informed that the regular troops
were on their march from Boston, in order (as it was said) to take the
colony stores then deposited at Concord, we met on the parade of our
company in this town. After the company had collected, we were ordered
by Captain Parker (who commanded us) to disperse for the present, and
to be ready to attend the beat of the drum; and accordingly the
company went into houses near the place of parade. We further testify
and say, that, about five o'clock in the morning, we attended the beat
of our drum, and were formed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span> on the parade; we were faced
toward the regulars then marching up to us, and some of our company
were coming to the parade with their backs toward the troops, and
others, on the parade, began to disperse, when the regulars fired on
the company, before a gun was fired by any of our company on them.
They killed eight of our company, and wounded several, and continued
their fire until we had all made our escape.</p>

pointed at said militia, and the regulars kept huzzaing till he had

secure herself and family, they all retired into the kitchen, in the
back part of the house. She soon found the house surrounded with the
king's troops; that upon observation made, at least seventy bullets
were shot into the front part of the house; several bullets lodged in
the kitchen where she was, and one passed through an easy-chair she
had just gone from. The door of the front part of the house was broke
open; she did not see any soldiers in the house, but supposed, by the
noise, they were in the front. After the troops had gone off, she
missed the following things, which, she verily believes, were taken
out of the house by the king's troops, viz., one rich brocade gown,
called a negligee, one lutestring gown, one white quilt, one pair of

proceeded to Lexington. On our arrival at that place, we saw a body of

On our approach, they dispersed, and soon after firing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span>
began, but which party fired first I can not exactly say, as our
troops rushed on shouting and huzzaing previous to the firing, which
was continued by our troops so long as any of the provincials were to
be seen. From thence we marched to Concord. On a hill, near the
entrance of the town, we saw another body of provincials assembled:
the light-infantry companies were ordered up the hill to disperse
them; on our approach, they retreated toward Concord. The grenadiers
continued the road under the hill toward the town. Six companies of
light infantry were ordered down to take possession of the bridge
which the provincials retreated over; the company I commanded was one.
Three companies of the above detachment went forward about two miles.
In the meantime, the provincial troops returned, to the number of
about three or four hundred. We drew up on the Concord side of the
bridge; the provincials came down upon us, upon which we engaged and
gave the first fire. This was the first engagement after the one at
Lexington. A continued firing from both parties lasted through the
whole day. I myself was wounded at the attack of the bridge, and am
now treated with the greatest humanity, and taken all possible care of

  <i>"To the Inhabitants of Great Britain.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Friends and Fellow-Subjects</span>: Hostilities are at length commenced in
this colony by the troops under the command of General Gage; and it
being of the greatest importance that an early, true, and authentic
account <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> of this inhuman proceeding, should be known to you,
the Congress of this colony have transmitted the same, and, from want
of a session of the Hon. Continental Congress, think it proper to
address you on the alarming occasion.</p>

<p>"By the clearest depositions relative to this transaction, it will
appear that, on the night preceding the 19th of April instant, a body
of the king's troops, under the command of Colonel Smith, were
secretly landed at Cambridge, with an apparent design to take or
destroy the military and other stores, provided for the defence of
this colony, and deposited at Concord; that some inhabitants of the
colony, on the night aforesaid, while travelling peaceably on the road
between Boston and Concord, were seized and greatly abused by armed
men, who appeared to be officers of General Gage's army; that the town
of Lexington by these means was alarmed, and a company of the
inhabitants mustered on the occasion; that the regular troops, on
their way to Concord, marched into the said town of Lexington, and the
said company on their approach began to disperse; that notwithstanding
this, the regulars rushed on with great violence, and first began
hostilities, by firing on said Lexington company, whereby they killed
eight, and wounded several others; that the regulars continued their
fire until those of said company, who were neither killed nor wounded,
had made their escape; that Colonel Smith, with the detachment, then
marched to Concord, where a number of provincials were again fired
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span> on by the troops, two of them killed and several wounded,
before the provincials fired on them; and that these hostile measures
of the troops produced an engagement that lasted through the day, in
which many of the provincials and more of the regular troops were
killed and wounded.</p>

<p>"To give a particular account of the ravages of the troops, as they
retreated from Concord to Charlestown, would be very difficult, if not
impracticable. Let it suffice to say, that a great number of the
houses on the road were plundered, and rendered unfit for use; several
were burnt; women in childbed were driven, by the soldiery, naked into
the streets; old men peaceably in their houses were shot dead; and
such scenes exhibited as would disgrace the annals of the most
uncivilized nations.</p>

<p>"These, brethren, are marks of ministerial vengeance against this
colony, for refusing, with her sister-colonies, a submission to
slavery; but they have not yet detached us from our royal sovereign.
We profess to be his loyal and dutiful subjects, and so hardly dealt
with as we have been, are still ready, with our lives and fortunes, to
defend his person, family, crown, and dignity. Nevertheless, to the
persecution and tyranny of his cruel ministry we will not tamely
submit: appealing to Heaven for the justice of our cause, we determine
to die or be free.</p>

<p>"We can not think that the honor, wisdom, and valor of Britons will
suffer them to be long inactive spectators of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span> measures in
which they themselves are so deeply interested&mdash;measures pursued in
opposition to the solemn protests of many noble lords, and expressed
sense of conspicuous commoners, whose knowledge and virtue have long
characterized them as some of the greatest men in the nation&mdash;measures
executing contrary to the interest, petitions, and resolves of many
large, respectable, and opulent counties, cities, and boroughs in
Great Britain&mdash;measures highly incompatible with justice, but still
pursued with a specious pretence of easing the nation of its
burdens&mdash;measures which, if successful, must end in the ruin and
slavery of Britain, as well as the persecuted American colonies.</p>

<p>"We sincerely hope that the great Sovereign of the universe, who hath
so often appeared for the English nation, will support you in every
rational and manly exertion, with these colonies, for saving it from
ruin; and that, in a constitutional connection with the
mother-country, we shall soon be altogether a free and happy people.</p>

<p><a id="footnote18" name="footnote18"></a>
<b>Footnote 18:</b> Fort Edward was situated upon the east bank of the
Hudson, about fifty miles north of Albany. The fort was built by
General Lyman, of Connecticut, in 1755, while that officer was
encamped there with about six thousand troops, awaiting the arrival of
General William Johnson, the commander-in-chief of the expedition
against the French at Ticonderoga and Crown Point. A portion of the
site of the fort is now (1854) occupied by the flourishing village of
Fort Edward. Some of the embankments are yet visible near the river.
It was near this fort that Jane McCrea was killed and scalped, in
1777.<a href="#footnotetag18">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote21" name="footnote21"></a>
<b>Footnote 21:</b> On the Mohawk, about five miles above Cohoes Falls. It
was the chief crossing-place for troops on their way north from
Albany. There the right wing of the American army, under Arnold, was
encamped, while General Schuyler was casting up entrenchments at
Cohoes Falls, a few weeks before the Saratoga battles, in
1777.<a href="#footnotetag21">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote22" name="footnote22"></a>
<b>Footnote 22:</b> Stillwater is on the west bank of the Hudson, in
Saratoga county, twenty-four miles north from Albany. The battle of
Bemis's heights was fought near there, in 1777, and is sometimes known
as the battle of Stillwater. Opposite the mouth of the Hoosick river,
at Stillwater, was a stockade, called Fort
Winslow.<a href="#footnotetag22">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote23" name="footnote23"></a>
<b>Footnote 23:</b> A batteau is a kind of scow or flat-boat, used on
shallow streams like the Hudson above
Waterford.<a href="#footnotetag23">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote24" name="footnote24"></a>
<b>Footnote 24:</b> Saratoga. This settlement was near the mouth of the Fish
creek, on the south side. The village of Schuylerville is just across
the stream, on the north side. On the plain, in front of the village
of Schuylerville, was a regular quadrangular fortification, with
bastions, called Fort Hardy. It was erected in 1756, and named in
honor of the governor of New York at that
time.<a href="#footnotetag24">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote25" name="footnote25"></a>
<b>Footnote 25:</b> On the west side of the Hudson, six or eight miles below
Fort Edward. The river is there broken by swift rapids. During this
campaign, Major (afterward General) Putnam was here surprised by a
party of Indians, and boldly descended the rapids in a canoe, and
escaped. It was a feat they never dared to attempt, and they felt
certain that he was under the protection of the Great Spirit. Here a
stream called Bloody Run enters the Hudson. It is so named because a
party of soldiers from the garrison, in 1759, went there to fish, were
surprised by the Indians, and nine were killed and
scalped.<a href="#footnotetag25">(Back)</a></p>

three miles below Fort Edward.<a href="#footnotetag29">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote30" name="footnote30"></a>
<b>Footnote 30:</b> General Phineas Lyman, who built Fort Edward. He was a
native of Durham, Connecticut, where he was born in 1716. He completed
his education at Yale college, and afterward became an eminent lawyer.
He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Connecticut forces in 1755,
and in the expedition to Lake George deserved all the honor awarded to
General Johnson, who was jealous of Lyman's abilities as a soldier.
Lyman did his duty nobly, and was but little noticed. Johnson was
unfit for his station, but being a nephew of Sir Peter Warren, then a
popular English admiral, he received the honor of knighthood, and the
sum of twenty thousand dollars, for his services in that campaign!
General Lyman served with distinction until the close of the campaign
in 1760, and in 1762 commanded the American forces sent against
Havana. He was in England about eleven years, and, after his return,
went with his family to the Mississippi, where he died in
1788.<a href="#footnotetag30">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote31" name="footnote31"></a>
<b>Footnote 31:</b> Colonel David Wooster, of Connecticut, the eminent
general of the Revolution, who was killed at Ridgefield, while engaged
in the pursuit of Tryon, after the burning of Danbury, in the spring
of 1777. He was born in Stratford, Connecticut, in March, 1710,
graduated at Yale college in 1738, and soon afterward received the
appointment of captain of a vessel of the coast-guard. He was in the
expedition against Louisburg in 1745. He afterward went to England,
where he was a favorite at the court of George II., and received the
appointment of captain in the regular service, under Sir William
Pepperell. He was promoted to a colonelcy in 1755, and rose to the
rank of brigadier before the close of the French and Indian war. He
was one of the most active men in getting up the expedition against
Ticonderoga, in 1775, which resulted in the capture of that fortress,
and also Crown Point, by Colonel Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold.
Wooster was appointed one of the first brigadiers of the continental
army, in 1775, and third in rank. He was also appointed the first
major-general of the militia of his state, when organized for the War
for Independence; and in that capacity he was employed, with Arnold,
Silliman, and others, in repelling British invasion in 1777. He lost
his life in that service. His remains were buried at Danbury; and in
1854 a monument was erected over his grave by his grateful countrymen,
at the expense of his native state.<a href="#footnotetag31">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote32" name="footnote32"></a>
<b>Footnote 32:</b> Chaplain.<a href="#footnotetag32">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote33" name="footnote33"></a>
<b>Footnote 33:</b> Commander of a corps of rangers, who performed signal
services during the greater part of the French and Indian war. He was
the son of an Irishman, an early settler of Dunbarton, in New
Hampshire. He was appointed to his command in 1755, and was a thorough
scout. In 1759, he was sent by General Amherst to destroy the Indian
village of St. Francis. In that expedition he suffered great
hardships, but was successful. He served in the Cherokee war in 1761,
and in 1766 was appointed governor of Michilimacinac, where he was
accused of treason, and sent to Montreal in irons. He was acquitted,
went to England, and, after suffering imprisonment for debt, returned
to America, where he remained until the Revolution broke out. He took
up arms for the king, and in 1777 went to England, where he died. His
"Journal of the French and Indian War" is a valuable
work.<a href="#footnotetag33">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote34" name="footnote34"></a>
<b>Footnote 34:</b> Israel Putnam, afterward the Revolutionary general. He
was born in Salem, Massachusetts, in January, 1718. He was a vigorous
lad, and in 1739 we find him cultivating land in Pomfret, Connecticut,
the scene of his remarkable adventure in a wolf's den, so familiar to
every reader. He was appointed to the command of some of the first
troops raised in Connecticut for the French and Indian war in 1755,
and was an active officer during the entire period of that conflict,
especially while in command of a corps of rangers. He was ploughing in
his field when the news of the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord
reached him. He immediately started for Boston, and, at the head of
Connecticut troops, was active in the battle of Bunker Hill. He was
one of the first four major-generals of the continental army appointed
by Congress in June, 1775, and he was constantly on duty in important
movements until 1779, when a partial paralysis of one side of his body
disabled him for military service. He lived in retirement after the
war, and died at Brooklyn, Windham county, Connecticut, on the 29th of
May, 1790, at the age of seventy-two years.<a href="#footnotetag34">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote35" name="footnote35"></a>
<b>Footnote 35:</b> General James Abercrombie, the commander-in-chief of the
campaign. He was descended from an ancient Scotch family, and, because
of signal services on the continent, was promoted to the rank of
major-general, the military art having been his profession since
boyhood. He was superseded by Lord Amherst, after his defeat at
Ticonderoga, and returned to England in the spring of
1759.<a href="#footnotetag35">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote36" name="footnote36"></a>
<b>Footnote 36:</b> Sabbath-day Point. This is a fertile little promontory,
jutting out into Lake George from the western shore, a few miles from
the little village of Hague, and surrounded by the most picturesque
scenery imaginable. It was so named, at this time, because it was
early on Sunday morning that Abercrombie and his army left this place
and proceeded down the lake. There a small provincial force had a
desperate fight with a party of French and Indians, in 1756, and
defeated them. Abercrombie's army went down the lake in batteaux and
whaleboats, and reached the Point just at dark. Captain (afterward
General) Stark relates that he supped with the young lord Howe that
evening, at the Point, and that the nobleman made many anxious
inquiries about the strength of Ticonderoga, the country to be
traversed, &amp;c., and, by his serious demeanor, evinced a presentiment
of his sad fate. He was killed in a skirmish with a French scout two
days afterward. His body was conveyed to Albany, in charge of Captain
(afterward General) Philip Schuyler, and buried there. He was a
brother of the admiral and general of that name, who commanded the
British naval and land forces in America in
1776.<a href="#footnotetag36">(Back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 37:</b> "The order of march," says Major Rogers, "exhibited a
splendid military show." There were sixteen thousand well-armed
troops. Lord Howe, in a large boat, led the van of the flotilla,
accompanied by a guard of rangers and expert boatmen. The regular
troops occupied the centre, and the provincials the wings. The sky was
clear and starry, and not a breeze ruffled the dark waters as they
slept quietly in the shadows of the mountains. Their oars were
muffled, and, so silently did they move on, that not a scout upon the
hills observed them; and the first intimation that the outposts of the
enemy received of their approach was the full blaze of their scarlet
uniforms, when, soon after sunrise, they landed and pushed on toward
Ticonderoga.<a href="#footnotetag37">(Back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 39:</b> The English lacked suitable guides, and became
bewildered in the dense forest that covered the land. Lord Howe was
second in command, and led the van, preceded by Major Putnam and a
scout of one hundred men, to reconnoitre. The French set fire to their
own outpost, and retreated. Howe and Putnam dashed on through the
woods, and in a few minutes fell in with the French advanced guard,
who were also bewildered, and were trying to find their way to the
fort. A smart skirmish ensued, and, at the first fire, Lord Howe,
another officer, and several privates, were killed. The French were
repulsed, with a loss of about three hundred killed, and one hundred
and forty made prisoners. The English battalions were so much broken,
confused, and fatigued, that Abercrombie ordered them back to the
landing-place, where they bivouacked for the
night.<a href="#footnotetag39">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote40" name="footnote40"></a>
<b>Footnote 40:</b> This was Abercrombie's fatal mistake. He sent an
engineer to reconnoitre the fort and outworks. The engineer reported
the latter to be so weak, in an unfinished state, as to be easily
carried, without artillery, by the force of English bayonets. The
difficulties in the way of heavy cannons, in that dense forest, were
very formidable; and Abercrombie was willing to rely upon sword and
bayonet, on the strength of his engineer's report. That functionary
was mistaken; and when the English approached the French lines, they
found an embankment of earth and stones, eight feet in height,
strongly guarded by <i>abatis</i>, or felled trees, with their tops
outward. The English made a furious attack, cut pathways through these
prostrate trees, and mounted the parapet. They were instantly slain,
and thus scores of Britons were sacrificed, by discharges of heavy
cannons. When two thousand men had fallen, Abercrombie sounded a
retreat, and the whole British army made its way to the landing-place
at the foot of Lake George, with a loss of twenty-five hundred
muskets. They went up the lake to Fort William Henry, and the wounded
were sent to Fort Edward and to Albany. At his own solicitation,
Colonel Bradstreet was sent to attack the French fort Frontenac, where
Kingston now stands, at the foot of Lake Ontario; and General Stanwix
proceeded to erect a fort toward the head-waters of the Mohawk, where
the village of Rome now flourishes.<a href="#footnotetag40">(Back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 55:</b> A severe engagement took place on Clear river, the west
branch of Wood creek, about a mile northwest from Fort Anne village
(then the site of a picketed blockhouse, called Fort Anne), between a
party of rangers and provincials under Rogers, Putnam, and Captain
Dalyell, or D'Ell, and about an equal number of French and Indians
under Molang, a famous partisan leader. The English troops were
marching when attacked: Putnam was in front, with the provincials;
Rogers was in the rear, with his rangers; and D'Ell in the centre,
with the regulars. Molang attacked them in front, and a powerful
Indian rushed forward and made Putnam a prisoner. The provincials
were thrown into great confusion, but were rallied by Lieutenant
Durkee, who was one of the victims of the Wyoming massacre twenty
years afterward. D'Ell, with Gage's light infantry, behaved very
gallantly, and the rangers finally put the enemy to flight. The latter
lost about two hundred men. Colonel Prevost, then in command at Fort
Edward, sent out three hundred men, with refreshments for the party,
and all arrived at Fort Edward on the 9th. This was the relief-party

garments were riddled by bullets, but, strange to say, not one touched
his person. He was carried away in the retreat, his wrists tightly
bound with cords. The Indians rejoiced over the capture of their great
enemy, and he was doomed to the torture. In the deep forest he was
stripped naked, bound to a sapling, wood was piled high around him,
the death-songs of the savages were chanted, and the torch was
applied. Just then a heavy shower of rain almost extinguished the
flames. They were again bursting forth with fiercer intensity, when a
French officer, informed of what was going on, darted through the
crowd of yelling savages, and released the prisoner. He was delivered
to Montcalm at Ticonderoga, then sent to Montreal, and, after being
treated kindly, was exchanged for a prisoner taken by Colonel
Bradstreet at Frontenac.<a href="#footnotetag60">(Back)</a></p>

logs, with portholes for cannon and loopholes for musketry, and
surrounded by a picket of pine-saplings. When the writer visited the
spot in 1848, he dug up the part of one of the pickets yet remaining
in the earth, and, on splitting it, it emitted the pleasant odor of a
fresh pine-log, though ninety years had elapsed since it was placed
there. This fort was near the bank of Wood creek, about eleven miles
from the head of Lake Champlain, at the village of Whitehall. It was
in the line of Burgoyne's march toward the Hudson, in 1777; and near
it quite a severe skirmish took place between Colonel Long, of
Schuyler's army, and a British detachment under Colonel Hill, on the
8th of July, the day after Ticonderoga was abandoned to the enemy.
Victory was almost within the grasp of Colonel Long, when his
ammunition failed, and he was compelled to

muskets, one hundred thousand flints, thirty thousand round shot for
one, six, and twelve pounders, over thirty thousand musket-shot, and a
thirteen-inch brass mortar that weighed twenty-seven hundred pounds.

<b>Footnote 207:</b> Here the Journal ends abruptly, and we have no clew to
the writer afterward. As he had enlisted for the campaign of 1776, he
doubtless remained with the army until after the expulsion of the
British from Boston, in March following, unless he was killed in some
of the skirmishes that frequently occurred, or was obliged to leave
the army on account of sickness. Whatever was his fate, the veil of
oblivion is drawn over it, for he was one of the thousands who with
warm hearts and stout hands struggled in the field for the liberties
of their country, lie in unhonored graves, and have had no
biographers. If he lived until the conflict ended, and died in his
native town, no doubt his grave is in the old churchyard at Wrentham.
His family was among the earliest settlers there, for Daniel Haws was
a resident of the village when it was burnt, in the time of King
Philip's war, almost two hundred years ago; and on a plain slab in
that old burial-place is the name of Ebenezer Haws, who died in 1812,
at the age of ninety-one years.<a href="#footnotetag207">(Back)</a></p>
